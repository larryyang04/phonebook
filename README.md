# Phonebook Application

## Built With
- Java

## Description

This is a program I created for the last project of my Intro to CS course. It is a program centered on object-oriented programming, employing objects, classes, interfaces, and user input to allow users to generate, store, and edit contact information, mirroring the functionality of a phonebook.

## How to Use
PhoneBookApplication.java contains the main method. The .txt files contain the login details for admin or normal user privileges.

## Takeaways

This project was a great introduction to object-oriented programming! I became familiar with many concepts in the OOP paradigm and implemented them in the project; these include:
- Class inheritance
- Composition
- Interfaces
- Abstract methods
- Polymorphism / Implicit casting
